<p>Hi, I'm Anthony. I have a B.A. from Eastern University where I studied Philosophy and Religion. After a 14 month stint teaching English in South Korea, I decided to move back to Philadelphia in late 2013 where I am currently pursing a career in web development. I am a lover of music, art, technology, literature, photography, travel and craft beer. Feel free to take a glance at some of my photography on my <a href="http://www.instagram.com/blankwaves">Instagram</a> if you're into that sort of thing.</p>

<p>In the development world, I enjoy contributing to open source, beta testing, web frameworks and responsive design. Since I'm still learning, I'm always looking for programming courses and books to engage in to expand my skills. When I'm not coding, I am looking to expand my <a href="https://www.discogs.com/user/alramella/collection" target="_blank">record collection</a>, riding my bike, hiking or reading (but very rarely will I do all four at the same time).</p>

<h3>This site</h3>
<p>I created this blog to share my experiences and challenges in learning code as well as some helpful insights and resources. It was built with <a href="http://www.jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, a static website generator powered by <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>.
