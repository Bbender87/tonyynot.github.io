These are some noteworthy links I've saved over the past few months. Going through my various bookmarks I realized I had a number of space related links so I decided to share them for a link roundup. If you are even remotely interested in space related things, you should enjoy at least 1 of these links!

[In Space We Trust](http://inspacewetrust.org/en/)<br>
This is an interactive site that lets you relive the history of space exploration. I should warn you, it takes a little while to load but it's well worth it. If you are even remotely interested in the history of space exploration, you will definitely come away with some interesting new facts. Did you know the first animals to go into orbit and return alive were 2 dogs? Too bad they had no idea where they were!

[No Man's Sky (Preview)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uMFHoF8VA)<br>
I haven't been this excited for a video game in a while. No Man's Sky is a space survival/exploration game in which players can freely roam around an open universe which includes 18 quintillion randomly generated planets. In this video, lead developer Sean Murray gives a walkthrough explaining what it is you actually do in this game. It's worth mentioning that the universe in the game is so expansive that 99.8% of all the planets will go undiscovered.

[Apollo 11 Lunar Landing in Real Time](http://www.firstmenonthemoon.com/)<br>
On this site, you can watch the first moon landing in real time, with audio from Houston as well as the Lunar and Command Module. I imagine the hours of fun I'd have with this as a kid. Even as an adult I find it pretty cool as a temporary distraction. Definitely worth checking out for a few minutes at least.

[Lightyear.fm](http://www.lightyear.fm/)<br>
Radio broadcasts leave Earth at the speed of light. Scroll away from Earth and hear how far the biggest hits of the past have travelled. The farther away you get, the longer the waves take to travel there—and the older the music you’ll hear.

[How Big Is Space](http://www.bbc.com/future/bespoke/20140304-how-big-is-space-interactive/index.html)<br>
Another interactive site from BBC that gives an idea of how our solar system scales to other massive occurances that have taken place on Earth. 

>"Space is big. Really big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist, but that's just peanuts to space."
-Douglas Adams
