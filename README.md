<p>I created this blog to share my experiences and challenges in learning code as well as some helpful insights and resources. It was built with [Jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com), a static website generator powered by [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/). I desgined and coded the site myself while learning [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/) and [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/).

A themed version of the site is currently in the works.
If you would like to use the theme prior to official release, please contact me. In the meantime, read about [how I designed and coded this blog](http://anthonyramella.com/blog/new-blog-design/).
