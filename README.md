<p>I created this blog to share my experiences and challenges in learning code as well as some helpful insights and resources. It was built with <a href="http://www.jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, a static website generator powered by <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>. I desgined and coded the site myself while learning <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a>, <a href="http://bourbon.io/">Bourbon</a> and <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a>.

A themed version of the site is currently in the works.
If you would like to use the theme prior to official release, please contact me.
